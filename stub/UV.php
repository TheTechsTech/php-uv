 * rely on the event loop to signal it about the socket status changes, like
 * c-ares or libssh2. Using uv_poll_t for any other other purpose is not
 * recommended; uv_tcp_t, uv_udp_t, etc. provide an implementation that is
 * much faster and more scalable than what can be achieved with uv_poll_t,
 * especially on Windows.
 *
 * It is possible that uv_poll occasionally signals that a file descriptor is
 * readable or writable even when it isn't. The user should therefore always
 * be prepared to handle EAGAIN or equivalent when it attempts to read from or
 * write to the fd.
 *
 * It is not okay to have multiple active uv_poll watchers for the same socket.
 * This can cause libuv to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.
 *
 * The user should not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an
 * active uv_poll watcher. This can cause the poll watcher to report an error,
 * but it might also start polling another socket. However the fd can be safely
 * closed immediately after a call to uv_poll_stop() or uv_close().
 *
 * On windows only sockets can be polled with uv_poll. On unix any file
 * descriptor that would be accepted by poll(2) can be used with uv_poll.

 * Initialize signal handle.

 * UNIX signal handling on a per-event loop basis. The implementation is not

 * signal watchers.
 *
 * Note to Linux users: `SIGRT0` and `SIGRT1` (signals 32 and 33) are used by the
 * NPTL pthreads library to manage threads. Installing watchers for those
 * signals will lead to unpredictable behavior and is strongly discouraged.
 * Future versions of libuv may simply reject them.
 *
 * Some signal support is available on Windows:
 *
 *   `SIGINT` is normally delivered when the user presses CTRL+C. However, like
 *   on Unix, it is not generated when terminal raw mode is enabled.
 *
 *   `SIGBREAK` is delivered when the user pressed CTRL+BREAK.
 *
 *   `SIGHUP` is generated when the user closes the console window. On `SIGHUP` the
 *   program is given approximately 10 seconds to perform cleanup. After that
 *   Windows will unconditionally terminate it.
 *
 *   `SIGWINCH` is raised whenever libuv detects that the console has been
 *   resized. `SIGWINCH` is emulated by libuv when the program uses an uv_tty_t
 *   handle to write to the console. `SIGWINCH` may not always be delivered in a
 *   timely manner; libuv will only detect size changes when the cursor is
 *   being moved. When a readable uv_tty_handle is used in raw mode, resizing
 *   the console buffer will also trigger a `SIGWINCH` signal.
 *
 * Watchers for other signals can be successfully created, but these signals
 * are never generated. These signals are: `SIGILL`, `SIGABRT`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGSEGV`,
 * `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL`.
 *
 * Note that calls to raise() or abort() to programmatically raise a signal are
 * not detected by libuv; these will not trigger a signal watcher.
